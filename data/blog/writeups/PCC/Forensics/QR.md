## Solution

This was the image that was given in the challenge, I tried to scan it with QR scanner but it was not showing any result.

After reading multiple article i find out about this web tool called QRAZYBOX.

LINK: https://merri.cx/qrazybox/

After some research i find out that this is a version 5 QR code. So after opening new project and selecting blank qr code i selected the version 5.

Next was selecting the mask, for this i just select every option and checks which mask is exact match, From which i identified that Mask L 2 was perfect match.

Then i start drawing the QR code here.

From which i got this binary

Just copied this binary and convert it to ascii from this website : https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/binary-to-ascii-text-converter
